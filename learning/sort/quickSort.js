// if the value is not lower tha the current index we replace the value of the next index with the current index   and the  value that was replace qe store it in a variable if(30> 4)  [1,30,30,5]  value stored in the variable == variable = 4

//then we check if the the value that was  store in the variable is lower that the current if it is we place it to the right of the sorted values in the array
